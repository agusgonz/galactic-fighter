## Usage

You have to survive waves of enemies that spawn every round, having to kill everyone in the map to continue to the next level.

Each enemy has its own behavior and the player has to adapt at the type of enemy and the quantity of them. While rounds are completed, more enemies will be coming.

The player movement is done with: W(to jump), A(to go left), D(to go right) and J(to punch). The player can jump indefinitely.
